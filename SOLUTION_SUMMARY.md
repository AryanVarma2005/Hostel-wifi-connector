# WiFi Auto Login - Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified

The original WiFi auto login script was failing because:

1. **ChromeDriver Dependency Issue**: The script was trying to download ChromeDriver from the internet, but since you weren't connected to the internet (that's why you needed to login), it couldn't download the driver.

2. **Wrong Login Method**: The script was using Selenium to automate browser interactions, but the captive portal actually uses a simple HTTP POST request to `/login.xml` endpoint.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Original Script (`wifi_auto_login.py`)
- **Removed Selenium dependency**: No longer requires ChromeDriver or browser automation
- **Direct HTTP requests**: Uses `requests` library to submit login form directly
- **Correct endpoint**: Uses `https://172.16.16.16:8090/login.xml` instead of the HTML page
- **Proper form data**: Sends username, password, mode=191, and btnSubmit=Login

### 2. Created Alternative Scripts
- **`simple_wifi_login.py`**: Simplified version with multiple fallback methods
- **`targeted_wifi_login.py`**: Optimized version using the exact working endpoint

### 3. Updated Batch Files
- **`start_simple_wifi_login.bat`**: Runs the simple version
- **`simple_direct_login.bat`**: Direct login with simple version
- **`start_targeted_wifi_login.bat`**: Runs the targeted version
- **`targeted_direct_login.bat`**: Direct login with targeted version

## How It Works Now

The login process now works as follows:

1. **Connection Check**: Script checks if internet is available
2. **Login Request**: If no internet, sends POST request to `/login.xml` with credentials
3. **Verification**: Waits 2 seconds and checks if internet is now available
4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitors connection and re-logs in when needed

## Working Endpoint

The captive portal accepts login requests at:
```
POST https://172.16.16.16:8090/login.xml
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD&mode=191&btnSubmit=Login
```

## Usage

### Direct Login (One-time)
```bash
python wifi_auto_login.py --direct-login
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
python wifi_auto_login.py
```

### Using Batch Files
- Double-click `start_wifi_login.bat` for monitoring
- Double-click `direct_login.bat` for one-time login

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `simple_wifi_login.py` - Simplified version
- `targeted_wifi_login.py` - Optimized version
- `start_simple_wifi_login.bat` - Batch file for simple version
- `simple_direct_login.bat` - Direct login for simple version
- `start_targeted_wifi_login.bat` - Batch file for targeted version
- `targeted_direct_login.bat` - Direct login for targeted version

### Modified Files:
- `wifi_auto_login.py` - Fixed to use HTTP requests instead of Selenium

## Testing Results

✅ **Direct Login**: Successfully logs in and confirms internet connection
✅ **Monitoring**: Continuously monitors connection and re-logs in when needed
✅ **No Dependencies**: Works without ChromeDriver or internet access for setup

## Configuration

The script uses the same `config.ini` file with your credentials:
```ini
[WiFiLogin]
login_url = https://172.16.16.16:8090/httpclient.html
username = 323103311016
password = Gvpce@12345

[Settings]
check_interval = 30
username_field_id = username
password_field_id = password
login_button_id = loginbutton
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the monitoring**: Run `python wifi_auto_login.py` and let it monitor your connection
2. **Set up auto-start**: Use the existing batch files to start automatically on boot
3. **Monitor logs**: Check `logs/wifi_login.log` for any issues

The WiFi auto login should now work reliably without requiring manual intervention!
